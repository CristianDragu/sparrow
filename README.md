# The Sparrow programming language

Welcome to the repository of the Sparrow compiler, the reference compiler for the Sparrow programming language.

## About

Sparrow is a general-purpose programming language that aims to integrate efficiency, flexibility and naturalness. It is flexible enough to allow the user to write efficient code in a method that does not compromise a natural manner. It features both low-level access code constructs and high-level features. One of the central features of the language is hyper-metaprogramming; this allows using complex data structures and algorithms at compile-time, as one typically does at run-time.

So far, we have a language that:
- it's as fast as C/C++
- it's easier to use than C++
- it's more flexible and powerful than a typical imperative language

We are continuing to improve the language to be even more faster, natural and flexible.

More information about the Sparrow programming langauge can be found on the [documentation page](http://sparrow-lang.readthedocs.io) page.

## Sparrow needs you!

Any contribution is welcome. You can implement new language features, new library features, fix bugs or even report issues. Just follow the [GitHub contributing guidelines](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

## Version
Sparrow is still in development. You can take the latest version of the code, compile it and have fun.

## Getting started
