PhD thesis documentation [slightly outdated]
============================================

- See the `PhD presentation <https://github.com/Sparrow-lang/sparrow-materials/blob/master/PhD/presentation_offline_Sparrow.pdf>`_ (accompanied by `this video <https://github.com/Sparrow-lang/sparrow-materials/blob/master/PhD/Speak.mp4>`_)
- Read the `PhD thesis on Sparrow <https://github.com/Sparrow-lang/sparrow-materials/blob/master/PhD/ThesisLucTeo.pdf>`_

These present a slightly outdated version of Sparrow, but nevertheless it provides a good tour of Sparrow's most important features, with multiple examples and measurements. It also contains the design rationale for Sparrow.
